Commit Message: Implement Client-Side Performance Improvements

Description:
In response to user feedback regarding laggy gameplay experiences in Sway Farm, this commit focuses on addressing client-side performance issues to enhance the overall gameplay experience. The following optimizations have been implemented:

1. Updated rendering algorithms to improve efficiency and reduce rendering latency.
2. Implemented data caching strategies to minimize unnecessary network requests and reduce client-side processing overhead.
3. Refactored code to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks, resulting in smoother gameplay on lower-end devices.
4. Integrated comprehensive error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle network interruptions and prevent gameplay disruptions.

These changes aim to significantly improve the responsiveness and fluidity of gameplay, particularly during peak hours when server load is high. Further monitoring and testing will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these optimizations and identify any additional areas for improvement.
